A test-driven-developed React app that lets the user find coding events in or near their city. Users can search for nearby cities and receive a list of suggested cities based on what they type in and can see a desired number of events listed. Users can also see 2 charts that indicate how many events are in each city as well as the percentage of events based on languages.

The app uses React, node.js, css, html, also testing with Enzyme, Puppeteer and is hosted using Github pages.
